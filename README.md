# Sorting Visualizer

Visualization of different sorting algorithms with this C++ project utilizing the SDL2 library. Experience the visual representation of renowned sorting methods such as Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. With a fixed list size of 130 elements, users can randomize the list and select any sorting algorithm for visualization, all converging to ascending order.


# How to Execute:

Utilize the C++ source code available in the repository (Sorting Visualizer.cpp) by installing and setting up the SDL2 library. Use x86_64-w64-mingw32 to setup the SDL2 files.

After SDL2 setup, include Sorting Visualizer.cpp in your project, configure the build options as per the tutorial, and run the project.
